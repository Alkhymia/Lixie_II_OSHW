These are STL files for 3D printing a base for your Lixie II displays! There's one piece per digit, use the left/right caps for the ends.

If you need a 3D print done, the cheapest option I've seen (at least here in the States) is [3DHubs.com](http://www.3dhubs.com). Make sure they are printing with the top-side down to save a lot on not having to print supports.

However, if you don't yet have a 3D printer...get one! Seriously, get one. I put if off for years thinking parts were brittle or ugly. With a modern printer you can only make a brittle or ugly part intentionally.

I use an Ender 3, and I love it. ([Amazon US Link](https://www.amazon.com/Comgrow-Creality-Ender-Aluminum-220x220x250mm/dp/B07BR3F9N6/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=ender+3&qid=1565688124&s=gateway&sr=8-4))
